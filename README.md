## PhD Course Assignment: Big Data Integration Project Paper

**Objective**:
Students will have the flexibility to choose between two project options:

Evaluation of Data Integration Techniques: Students will evaluate a set of data integration techniques on a dataset/domain of their choice.
Evaluation and Comparison of Data Integration Techniques: Students will conduct an experimental evaluation and comparison of multiple data integration techniques on known benchmarks (i.e., by employing the datasets employed in the referenced papers).

**Assignment Guidelines**:

- Paper Length: ~2 pages long.
- Project Options:
Option 1: Individual Project---Students can choose to work on the project individually.
Option 2: Group Project (Two Members)---Students can opt to work in pairs. Each member must specify their contribution to the project.
- Project Proposal: Before starting the project, students must submit a brief proposal outlining their chosen project option, dataset/domain of interest, and the specific data integration techniques they plan to evaluate or compare.
- Experimental Design:
Define clear objectives for the experiment.
Describe the dataset/domain chosen for the evaluation/comparison.
Detail the data integration techniques selected for evaluation/comparison.
Justify the selection of techniques based on relevance to the chosen dataset/domain and existing literature.
- Implementation:
Implement the chosen data integration techniques within a suitable environment.
Document the implementation process, including any challenges faced and solutions devised.
- Experimental Evaluation:
Include relevant metrics for evaluation, such as precision/recall, scalability, and any domain-specific measures if needed.
Provide detailed experimental results, including tables, charts, or visualizations where applicable.
- Comparison (if applicable):
If comparing multiple techniques, provide a comparison of their performance based on the selected metrics.
Analyze and interpret the results to draw meaningful conclusions.
- Discussion:
Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated/compared techniques.
Propose potential areas for further research or improvement.
- Contribution Statement (for group projects):
Each group member must include a contribution statement outlining their individual contributions to the project.
- References:
Include a list of all references cited in the paper following the appropriate citation style (e.g., APA, IEEE).
- Submission Guidelines:
send by email a pdf file.

- Assessment Criteria:
The papers will be assessed based on the following criteria:
    - Clarity and organization of the paper.
    - Thoroughness and relevance of the experimental evaluation/comparison.
    - Quality of analysis and interpretation of results.
    - Originality and creativity in the choice of dataset/domain and techniques.
    - Contribution (for group projects).
- Important Dates:
    - **Proposal Submission Deadline: 15/06/2024**
    - **Final Paper Submission Deadline: 30/06/2024**

Note: Any deviations from the assignment guidelines must be discussed and approved by the course instructor in advance.
